## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` — production build (includes type check)
- `npm run start` — serve the built app
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint checks (use `-- --fix` to auto-fix)

## Prisma Notes

- `npx prisma migrate dev` — apply migrations locally
- `npx prisma studio` — inspect the database via Prisma Studio
- `npx prisma migrate deploy` — apply migrations in production

## Deployment

### Production Deployment ✅

**Live URL**: [apptracker.tickideas.org](https://apptracker.tickideas.org)

The application is successfully deployed to Vercel with:
- **Database**: Prisma Cloud PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Environment-based credentials
- **Build**: Optimized production build with Prisma client generation
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 compatibility fixes

### New Deployment Setup

To deploy a new instance:
1. Set up a managed Postgres database (Prisma Cloud, Neon, or Supabase)
2. Configure environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
   - `LOGIN_USERNAME` - Admin username
   - `LOGIN_PASSWORD` - Secure password
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Random secret for session security
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Your production domain (e.g., `https://yourapp.domain.com`)
3. Deploy to Vercel (build script includes `prisma generate`)

### Security Notes

- Change the default `LOGIN_USERNAME` and `LOGIN_PASSWORD` in production
- Use a strong, randomly generated `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- **CRITICAL**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your production domain for working share links
- Consider using environment-specific secrets for enhanced security

### Future Enhancements

Based on the [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md) roadmap:

- **Deployments view**: Release management and version tracking
- **Testing & Quality**: Unit tests with Vitest and E2E tests with Playwright
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Advanced filtering by period and date ranges
- **Team Features**: Multi-tenant support and user roles
- **Advanced GitHub Features**: Pull request tracking, release monitoring, and CI/CD integration
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Quick stats and completion metrics across apps

### Current Limitations

- Single user system (perfect for personal use)
- Manual progress updates (no automated tracking)
- No deployment tracking yet
- No mobile app version
